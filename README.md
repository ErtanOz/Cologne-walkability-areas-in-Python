## Overview

The project analyzes the walkability of areas around central points of interest in Cologne, such as the central train station (KÃ¶ln Hauptbahnhof) and the University of Cologne. It calculates isochrone maps showing walking distances in intervals of 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 minutes.

### Key Features:
- Geospatial analysis using Python libraries (e.g., GeoPandas, Folium, OSMnx)
- Isochrone calculations for walking distances
- Visualization of walkability areas in Cologne
